I&#39;m RobotLeopard86. I&#39;m a passionate programmer and gamer.
	<br/>
	I will soon be starting my own YouTube channel, and I&#39;m excited to see you there!
	<br/>
	Regarding gaming, I play singleplayer games mostly, usually puzzle, strategy, or platformers.
	<br/>
	When programming, I most commonly use C++ and Java, but I also sometimes use Svelte (with TypeScript) and C#.
	<br/>
	Some of my favorite games are Portal 2, Will You Snail, A Hat in Time, Plague Inc: Evolved, and Minecraft.
